# Gun-Violence-Severity-Prediction
This data mining project uses a dataset of gun-related incidents to predict the severity of an incident (whether it will be fatal or cause serious harm), based on various features such as location, time, weapon type, victim info, and more.

Project Overview:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis - EDA
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Imbalanced class handling
- Metrics: Precision, Accuracy, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix
